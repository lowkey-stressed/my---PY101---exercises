# Write a program named greeter.py that greets 'Victor' three times. 
# Your program should use a variable and not hard code the string value 
# 'Victor' in each greeting. 
# Here's an example run of the program:


name = 'Victor'

print('Good Morning, ' + name + '.')
print('Good Afternoon, ' + name + '.')
print('Good Evening, ' + name + '.')
