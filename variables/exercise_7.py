#What happens when you run the following code? Why?

# NAME = 'Victor'
# print('Good Morning, ' + NAME)
# print('Good Afternoon, ' + NAME)
# print('Good Evening, ' + NAME)

# NAME = 'Nina'
# print('Good Morning, ' + NAME)
# print('Good Afternoon, ' + NAME)
# print('Good Evening, ' + NAME)

# In the first block of code, NAME is 
# assigned the value of Victor and 
# stored in some memory address, 
# before it is printed 3 times.

# In the second block of code, NAME 
# is re-assigned the value of Nina, 
# and stored in a separate, new memory address,
# before it is printed 3 times.
# The value of Victor that was assigned to NAME earlier,
# still exists at the original memory address.
